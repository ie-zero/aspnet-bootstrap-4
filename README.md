# [:construction:] .NET templates (aspnet/templating) with Bootstrap 4

Very Much In Progress. The BS 4 has landed, but not yet in your VS 2017 and there is no current plan to change this AFAIK.

Note that some content here is no longer applicable to a current aspnet/templating content (`Gulp`-ing, `Bower`-ing no more, what's up with updates folks?) before the sample is fully rewritten.

## ASP.NET 5 Bootstrap  4

This is work in progress. The current `most wanted` high priority topic is how to use `Font Awesome 5` here with `Bootstrap 4` - as the parts of the managers areas use older `glyphicons`.

### TODO

- [x] figure out the general assets update
- [x] update Bootstrap assets to version 4
- [x] update jQuery to version 3.*.*
- [x] update jQuery-Validate plugin
- [x] update jQuery unobstrusive-validation plugin
- [x] update general template markup to match Boostrap 4 chagnes
- [x] simplify general template
- [ ] Font Awesome 5
- [ ] subpages and subtamplates rewrite and update
